# Office Building Electrical Design Project

## Project Overview

The "Office Building Electrical Design" project was a personal endeavor aimed at developing proficiency in AutoCAD and gaining practical knowledge about electrical design principles. The primary focus of the project was to create an efficient and sustainable lighting layout for an office building using Dialux Evo, a powerful lighting simulation software. Through this project, I sought to understand the intricacies of electrical design, learn to use industry-standard software, and apply sustainable practices in lighting systems.

## Key Objectives

1. **AutoCAD Proficiency**: The project began with the import of an AutoCAD file into Dialux Evo, allowing me to understand the importance of accurate drawings and how they impact the lighting design process.

2. **Electrical Design Principles**: By creating the lighting layout for the office building, I delved into electrical design concepts, such as lux levels, lighting uniformity, and choosing appropriate luminaires.

3. **Energy-Efficient Lighting**: A significant objective was to focus on energy efficiency by selecting LED luminaires over traditional fluorescent lamps, contributing to sustainable lighting practices.

4. **Night-Based Design**: The lighting layout was strategically planned based on night conditions, considering factors like workspace productivity and energy consumption during non-daylight hours.

5. **Customization for Optimal Lighting**: Each room's lighting design was individually tailored to meet target lux values and specific lighting requirements, enhancing the overall comfort and functionality of the workspace.

6. **Hands-on Learning with Dialux Evo**: The project provided valuable hands-on experience with Dialux Evo, enabling me to simulate lighting scenarios and analyze the performance of different lighting setups.

7. **Electrical Setup Integration**: After finalizing the lighting design in Dialux Evo, the project extended to AutoCAD, where I learned to integrate the lighting plan with the electrical setup. This included adding wiring, switches, sockets, and distribution panels.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Lighting Uniformity Challenges**: Addressing issues related to lighting uniformity taught me the importance of iterative adjustments and a room-specific approach to lighting design.

- **Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality**: Designing the lighting layout required finding a balance between aesthetics, energy efficiency, and meeting the functional needs of office spaces.

- **Integration Complexity**: Integrating the lighting plan into the overall electrical setup in AutoCAD highlighted the need for meticulous planning and attention to detail.

## Conclusion

The "Office Building Electrical Design" project provided me with an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to develop proficiency in AutoCAD, gain practical knowledge of electrical design principles, and apply lighting simulation using Dialux Evo. It was a journey of exploration into various aspects of electrical design to create a well-rounded lighting layout for office spaces. As a solo project, it challenged me to take on various tasks independently and fostered humility in acknowledging that there is always more to learn and improve upon in the field of electrical design.
